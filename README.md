# heart-stroke-prediction
•	Developed a predictive model to assess stroke risk using health data (age, BMI, heart disease, etc.). Performed data cleaning, EDA, and feature engineering. Trained and compared ML models (Logistic Regression, SVM, KNN, Decision Tree) with up to 93.8% accuracy. 
•	Also implemented an LSTM model using PyTorch to experiment with sequence learning. Uncovered key insights and unusual trends in stroke risk factors.
